# OpenSSF Community

Welcome to the OpenSSF Community!

This repo is the starting point for joining and contributing to the Open Source Security Foundation's workstreams, of which there are many.

ðŸš§ This Repo Is Under Construction ðŸš§

# Communications

Most communications happen in the following locations:
- On the [OpenSSF Slack](https://slack.openssf.org/) instance
- On one of the [OpenSSF Mailing Lists](https://lists.openssf.org/g/main/subgroups)
- On regularly scheduled Zoom meetings, which you can find on our [Community Calendar](https://calendar.google.com/calendar?cid=czYzdm9lZmhwNWk5cGZsdGI1cTY3bmdwZXNAZ3JvdXAuY2FsZW5kYXIuZ29vZ2xlLmNvbQ)

Most official meetings are public, and recordings are uploaded to the [OpenSSF YouTube Channel](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUdhiXNEBEayowJXY_v7AXQ/)

# Governance

Overall governance of the OpenSSF is defined in [the Foundation Charter](https://cdn.platform.linuxfoundation.org/agreements/openssf.pdf). 

The OpenSSF has the following types of officially supported groups:

- The **Governing Board** (GB) oversees the budget and legal status/structure of the OpenSSF. Board meetings may or may not be open to the public.
- **Committees** are formed by, and report to, the Board. Broadly speaking, Committees handle non-technical matters as needed by the GB, wherein a named set of people are tasked with handling a specific objective. Like the Board meetings, Committee meetings may or may not be open to the public.
- The **Technical Advisory Council** (TAC) is responsible for the general success of all Technical Initiatives (defined below). TAC meetings are generally open to the public, with the exception of special sessions. 
  - TAC membership is limited to seven (7) seats, with alternating elections every year. Contributors to Technical Initiatves may run, and each contributor may vote once in TAC elections. 
- Each **Technical Initiatives** (both Projects and Working Groups) is governed by its own Charter, which is approved by the TAC. Changes to a Charter must be approved first according to that Charter's terms and then by the TAC.
  - All Technical Initiatives are persistent open groups focused on a technical objective, with transparent proceedings that are open to the public, and vary in their objectives.
- A **Project** is a persistent and open group focused on the creation and ongoing support of open source licensed software (source code) and its supporting artifacts (documentation, etc). Projects usually manage one or more GitHub repos of their own, may have separate meetings, etc.
- A **Working Group** (WG) is also a persistent and open group focused on a particular aspect of the overall mission of the OpenSSF. Working Groups generally do not produce open source software as a primary artifact, though they often include some open source code, or even use licensed software, in fulfilment of their Charter.
  - WG's may be bounded in scope -- for example, their charter may specify that the WG will wrap up after a specific event, such as a publication.
  - WG's may also be unbounded in scope -- for instance, where an effort is expected to be ongoing in support of open source security indefinitely.
